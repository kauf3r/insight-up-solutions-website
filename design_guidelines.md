# Insight Up Solutions - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach**: Given the technical, professional nature of UAV solutions and the need for credibility with specialized professionals, we'll use a **Clean, Technical Design System** inspired by enterprise SaaS platforms like Linear and Notion, emphasizing clarity and trust-building.

## Key Design Principles
- **Credible & Technical**: Professional appearance that builds confidence
- **Clean & Minimal**: Avoid marketing hype, focus on clear information
- **Educational Journey**: Guide users from learning to confident inquiry
- **Payload-Centric**: Feature high-quality sensor and equipment imagery

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode (Primary)**:
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Text: Dark charcoal (220 15% 15%)
- Primary Brand: Deep technical blue (220 90% 35%)
- Secondary: Neutral gray (220 10% 60%)
- Accent: Minimal use of technical green (160 60% 45%) for success states only

**Dark Mode**: Not specified in requirements - focus on light background theme

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (clean, technical readability)
- **Headings**: Inter Bold/Semibold, larger scales for hierarchy
- **Body**: Inter Regular, optimized for technical content reading
- **Technical Specs**: Inter Medium for specification tables

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Use consistent units of **2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16** for:
- Padding: p-4, p-6, p-8
- Margins: m-4, m-6, m-8
- Gaps: gap-6, gap-8, gap-12
- Heights: h-12, h-16 for components

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**: Clean header with company logo, minimal main navigation
**Product Cards**: Professional grid layout with high-quality payload images
**Tabbed Interface**: For product specs, downloads, and sample data
**Forms**: Clean, validated forms using react-hook-form with clear labels
**Buttons**: Primary (filled), Secondary (outline), minimal hover states
**Data Tables**: Technical specifications in clean, scannable format

### E. Animations
**Minimal & Purposeful**: Subtle hover states on cards, smooth page transitions only. No distracting animations that detract from technical credibility.

## Page-Specific Design

### Homepage
- **Hero Section**: Large, professional image of Trinity Pro UAV in action
- **Key Payloads**: Grid showcasing Sony ILX-LR1 and Qube 640 with specs
- **Solution Preview**: Brief industry applications with clear CTAs
- **Professional Trust Signals**: Technical credentials, certifications

### Product Pages
- **Image Gallery**: High-resolution payload and UAV photography
- **Tabbed Content**: Specifications, Downloads, Sample Data
- **Clear CTAs**: "Request Quote" and "Book Demo" prominently placed
- **Technical Data**: Clean tables and specification sheets

### Solutions Pages
- **Industry Focus**: Surveying, Agriculture, Public Safety sections
- **Workflow Illustrations**: Show how products solve specific problems
- **Case Study Format**: Real-world applications with data samples

## Images
**Required Photography**:
- **Hero Image**: Trinity Pro UAV in professional surveying environment
- **Payload Close-ups**: High-detail shots of Sony ILX-LR1 and Qube 640 sensors
- **Application Images**: UAVs in agriculture, surveying, and public safety contexts
- **Data Sample Outputs**: Screenshots of mapping data, thermal imagery
- **Equipment Accessories**: Clean product shots for e-commerce section

**Image Treatment**: Clean, professional photography with consistent lighting. Avoid heavy filters - maintain technical authenticity.

This design approach prioritizes credibility and technical clarity while maintaining modern web standards, perfectly aligning with the professional UAV market requirements.
